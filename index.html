    <h1>Freedom Protocols</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Bitcoin as a protocol for free digital money</p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <!-- PROBLEM -->
    <h2>The context</h2>
    <p>
      Money is a technology. Like all technologies, it can be designed to empower many or to concentrate power in the hands of a few.
    </p>
    <p>
      As money becomes fully digital, centralized control over that technology creates a risk: total oversight of economic life.
    </p>

    <!-- ALTERNATIVE -->
    <h2>A different path</h2>
    <p>
      Bitcoin introduces a new model of money: digital, decentralized, and governed by transparent rules rather than institutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has no owner, no central authority, and no intermediaries. It operates as a protocol — neutral, global, and verifiable by anyone.
    </p>

    <!-- PROJECT -->
    <h2>What Freedom Protocols does</h2>
    <p>
      Freedom Protocols is an open educational project focused on helping people understand why Bitcoin matters, how it works, and what changes when money itself becomes a protocol.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are no products, no tokens, and no promises of profit. Only education, explanation, and first principles.
    </p>

    <!-- SUSTAINABILITY -->
    <h2>How it is sustained</h2>
    <p>
      All content is freely accessible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who find value in the material may choose to make a voluntary $10 donation through an ownerless smart contract.
    </p>
    <p>
      No obligation. No pressure. The funding model follows the same principles it teaches.
    </p>

    <!-- CLOSING -->
    <div class="quote">
      Bitcoin is not the salvation of institutions.<br />
      It is the opportunity for digital money to remain money for everyone.
    </div>

    <footer>
      <p>
        Freedom Protocols is an open project. The knowledge is free. The code is verifiable.
