    <div class="divider"></div>

    <h2>1. Money is a technology</h2>
    <p>
      Money is not just paper, numbers, or symbols. It is a technology created to enable exchange between humans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exchange makes cooperation possible. Cooperation makes specialization possible. Specialization is what allows societies to grow.
    </p>
    <p>
      When money works well, cooperation flows. When money is broken, everything built on top of it becomes fragile.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Centralization concentrates power</h2>
    <p>
      Throughout history, most monetary systems have been centralized. Control over money has usually been placed in the hands of institutions, governments, or intermediaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Centralization creates points of failure. It introduces incentives for corruption, manipulation, and exclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a system requires trust in a small group of actors, that trust will eventually be abused.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Digital money amplifies the risk</h2>
    <p>
      Digital technology increases efficiency, speed, and scale. But it also increases control.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fully centralized digital money enables surveillance, censorship, and the ability to freeze or condition economic activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      A world with centralized digital money is a world where economic freedom becomes permission-based.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Bitcoin changes the model</h2>
    <p>
      Bitcoin introduces a fundamentally different approach to money.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is digital, decentralized, and governed by transparent rules instead of authorities. It has no owner, no central issuer, and no intermediary that can change the system at will.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bitcoin operates as a protocol — like the internet — neutral, global, and verifiable by anyone.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Rules over trust</h2>
    <p>
      Bitcoin does not ask for trust in people, institutions, or intentions.
    </p>
    <p>
      It replaces trust with verifiable rules enforced by mathematics, cryptography, and distributed consensus.
    </p>
    <p>
      This shift reduces the need for intermediaries and removes many of the incentives that historically corrupt monetary systems.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Education over persuasion</h2>
    <p>
      Freedom Protocols exists to explain, not to convince.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe understanding is more powerful than marketing, and education is more sustainable than persuasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one should adopt a monetary system based on slogans or promises. Verification must come before belief.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Freedom is collective</h2>
    <p>
      Economic freedom is not an individual privilege. It is a collective property.
    </p>
    <p>
      A monetary system that can be controlled, censored, or manipulated eventually affects everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bitcoin offers a path toward money that belongs to no one and can be used by everyone.
    </p>

      Freedom is not guaranteed by intentions.<br />
      It is preserved by systems.

        Freedom Protocols is an open educational project. The knowledge is free. The rules are transparent.
